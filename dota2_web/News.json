We're happy to announce a massive Dota/[url=\"https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34827959\"]Monster Hunter[/url] crossover with new sets, new pets, a new in-game hunt and crafting system, and of course monsters. (For everyone who thinks Dragon Knight turning into a dragon is awesome but would be [i]more[/i] awesome if he turned into Rathalos instead, great news: Capcom was just as excited as we were to make this happen).[/p]\n[p]There are six Monster Hunter-themed item sets to collect in all, each bringing a classic Monster Hunter armor set into the Dota world, and each with three craftable alternate versions. There's also a new Palico courier with craftable costumes, and even your very own pet Poogie with craftable outfits. Your Poogie will hang out in your base, waiting to give you love whenever you return (and, assuming he is house trained, not pooping on your base).[/p]\n[p]The core version of each hero set is available to all Dota players for free, and can be crafted once you've harvested the necessary materials from hero hunts. In addition, the Hero Atlas will help you track your progress, explore hero lore, and gather dispatches from the farthest realms, penned by Axe's loyal scribe Goodkind.[/p]\n[p]For those that want more, the Expedition Pack includes more of everything: usable Monster Hunter monsters (Rathalos for Dragon Knight and the Bullfango for Beastmaster), a Monster Hunter music pack and seasonal spray collection, and a bundle of crafting materials to get you started. Expedition Pack holders can also craft exclusive Poogie, Palico, and hero set variants with custom ambient and Immortal effects.[/p]\n[p]The hunt is on, and will run for the next three months. Get in the game, vanquish your enemies, and transform your victories into new items. Oh, and look out for monsters.[/p]",

Which of course means the workshop is near-to-bursting with game-worthy sets, and — you guessed it by cleverly reading the title above — we'd love your help choosing which of those awesome sets next make their way into the game.\n\nIf that sounds fun, it's easy to chime in. Just jump on into the Dota 2 dashboard, click the Collector's Cache Voting button, and then upvote or downvote the sets as you see fit. Voting is open from now until October 22, so make sure you dig through all the offerings before then. You'll soon see the most popular sets strutting, slithering, and skittering through your lanes.\n\nSo many of our updates, ranging from treasures like Collector's Caches and Heroes' Hoards all the way to events like Crownfall, include amazing contributions from our community artists who first and foremost are Dota fans just like you. In this and countless other ways, Dota fans don't just play the game we all love, they help shape it. We hope you'll jump into the voting queue and have your say.[/p]",
