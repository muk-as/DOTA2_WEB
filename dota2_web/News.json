Just remember to scan out as you leave so you can re-enter later in the day if you’d like.\n[*]Each day of the event, you'll get a new commemorative badge with a unique code that can be registered to your Steam account for potential Crimson Witness treasure drops. (The URL for registration is on the badge.)[/list]\n[h3]What Else?[/h3]\nThat's it for now. Honestly, that was a lot of information, and we're not going to lie, there might even be more on the way. But for now, don't worry about it. Just sit back, relax, and reread this blog post until you can recite it phonetically. We'll be calling everyone personally to verify you've got it memorized. You got this! Talk soon.\n\n",

This year, to remove distracting elements and allow full focus on the game and the people playing it, we aren't going to have advertisements and sponsorships in-game at The International, including in team banners, base logos, and tags in player names.\n\nWe're only a few short weeks away from opening the curtain on this year's tournament. Whether you're meeting up in Denmark, or watching online, we'll see you soon.",
