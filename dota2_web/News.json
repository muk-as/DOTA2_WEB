After a year of mixed results, Team Falcons finally soared to the Aegis of Champions in Hamburg — by clawing, scrapping, and grinding through one of the grittiest marathons The International has ever seen. Of their ten series, only three were sweeps. Every other battle went the distance, including a five-game Grand Final.\n\nFalcons established themselves early with 2-1 wins over Nemesis and Tundra. Their first stumble came against Xtreme Gaming in a three-hour slugfest. Falcons ultimately fell, but their resilience was on full display. Next, they wiped away Team Liquid 2-0, but the following series against Tidebound was much more turbulent. Falcons lost, and suddenly elimination was looming. Their opponent in the elimination round? Team Spirit, the tournament favorites. The Result? A 2-0 statement from Falcons that sent the perennial powerhouse packing. Team Falcons had found their wings just in time for the main stage.\n\nThey opened in Barclays Arena with a vengeance: a 2-0 sweep over Tidebound. Against BB Team, Falcons dropped the first match. Instead of playing it safe, they leaned into an aggressive draft to win game two. In game three, Falcons quickly put BB into a chokehold. PVISION was next. Falcons absorbed a painful stomp in game one, but rolled away with game two to even the set. To cap it off in game three, Falcons punched their ticket to the Grand Final by delivering an hour-long triumph that had the crowd roaring at the events on stage.\n\nTo claim the Aegis of Champions on the final day, Team Falcons would need to defeat the only other team that had beaten them. Xtreme Gaming had survived an intense lower bracket final to set up a fitting rematch. In the first game, Xtreme carved Falcons apart. Falcons answered right back with a stunning beatdown in the next one. Game three seemed evenly matched — until a game-turning team wipe pushed Falcons into a 1-2 series hole. They clawed back in game four to stave off elimination and force a decisive game five.\n\nIn the decider, a strong draft from Falcons unleashed a disruptive combo into the fray, and from minute 15 onward they took control of the map. Xtreme Gaming made a valiant effort at defense, but in the end Team Falcons tore into the enemy heroes and smashed down the Ancient — and the Aegis of Champions was theirs to claim.\n\nAs bearers of the ultimate symbol of victory, these names shall forever be inscribed upon the Aegis of Champions:\n\n[b]2025 - Team Falcons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Oliver \"skiter\" Lepko\n[*]Stanislav \"Malr1ne\" Potorak\n[*]Ammar \"AMMAR_THE_F\" Alassaf\n[*]Andreas \"Cr1t-\" Nielsen\n[*]Jingjun \"Sneyking\" Wu\n[/list]\n\n[b]Looking Back[/b]\nLike Dota itself, The International is an awe-inspiring mixture of countless moving parts.

Remember, with great gravitas comes great responsibility. We trust you'll choose your moments well.\n[/p]\n\n[h2]Fantasy & Predictions[/h2][p]Lastly, we'd like to congratulate everyone who correctly predicted the placement of all sixteen teams at the Road to the International. All zero of you. That's right, despite millions upon millions of predictions, exactly no-one got this right. (0.02% of you got at least ten right, so if that's you, it's time to be proud.) To everyone whose fantasy and Road to The International predictions didn't pan out, now's your chance to get your predictions for the main event locked. World-class Dota at the best esports event of the year resumes on Thursday. We'll see you there.[/p]",
