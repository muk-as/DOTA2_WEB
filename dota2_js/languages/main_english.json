Holding R1 selects page 2 of abilities, while holding R2 shows page 1 of items and R1+R2 shows page 2 of items. For example, to cast TP, hold R1+R2 and press the A button. The D-pad selects various shortcuts in the UI to level up abilities, purchase quickbuy items, and open the shop. There's a second page of shortcuts to select units that you can access by holding R1. L1 and L2 are used to lock targets — L1 targets an ally, while L2 targets enemies. While holding L1 or L2, the face buttons will target different types of units (creeps, buildings, or heroes). Any attacks or abilities will try to target the locked unit first, to make it easier to land spells with the controller. Move the camera to \"break\" the target lock.",

The global Regions are: North America (NA), South America (SA), Western Europe (WEU), Eastern Europe (EEU), China (CN), and Southeast Asia (SEA).
