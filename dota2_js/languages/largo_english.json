  "largo_website_introduction": "The exiled Murkroots of Velu’Mar discovered a living island so ancient it speaks only in song. Raised among the shamanic bards who learned to commune with it, Largo now roams the realms with a troupe of frogling disciples, looking for inspiration for new melodies to bring back home. <br><br>On the battlefield, Largo amplifies his allies, inspiring efficient spellcasting and projecting greater harm upon his foes. He's quick to catch friends and enemies alike, controlling the flow of a skirmish with his sticky tongue, and his froglings are always eager to stomp around underfoot. When a battle really gets hopping, Largo's happy to step into the spotlight and play the hits, strumming his set list of Murkroot classics that grant his team powerful blessings to slide the tone and tempo of a fight firmly into their own favor.",
